Hi -

Thanks for your interest in Trading Economics.
To continue with the selection process we ask you to do a small task to prove your skills.
You can do so in any programming language and you can pick the topic.
The steps are as follows:
1 - Signup for an account at developer.tradingeconomics.com. There is no cost associated with joining TE and we promise not to share your your details with anyone.
2 - Then please join Github.com if you haven't. Head to https://github.com/tradingeconomics/tradingeconomics and do a fork followed by a pull of the repository to your PC/Mac.
3 - Go to docs.tradingeconomics.com and check what endpoints we expose.
4 - Use our search and find out what we have that you might find interesting:
4.1 - use https://brains.tradingeconomics.com/v2/search/wb,fred,comtrade?q=nigeria&pp=50&p=0&_=1557934352427&stance=2.
4.2 - Modify the 'q' query string to search whatever you see fit. And consider that our free developer accounts only have access to some databases.
5 - Implement a small script, app or website using an endpoint available in the docs and a time series you found in the search. Some examples of apps can be:
5.1 - A website that compares two countries or two indicators.
5.2 - Plotting charts after choosing a country - indicator pair.
5.3 - Build a web page with a table that displays information.
5.4 - Anything you like.
6 - Submit the code to the GitHub fork you did above.
7 - Send the GitHub link to our email at careers@tradingeconomics.com.
There is no time limit but we hope to hear from you soon!

Best regards,
Trading Economics Team
